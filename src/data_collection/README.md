# Data Collection.

Data collection is tantamount to this project! To provide statistically-backed
route reccomendations that incorporates multiple modes of transportation, we
will require the following data for each mode of transport:
- geospatial information (where is each **active** station)
- historical trip information (how long does each trip take, how long is the wait period at this location).
- Live-feed information if we want to give precise in the moment data.
- If trip length varies amongst a demographic, sufficient data to make
reasonable estimates.
